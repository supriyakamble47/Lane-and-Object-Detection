# Lane-and-Object-Detection

This project presents a study of deep learning models - Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) for object detection and Canny Edge-Hough Transform for lane detection. We have analyzed the deep learning models on the KITTI dataset and have observed that Faster-RCNN with ResNet-50 as backbone model is performing better for the object, lane, and anomaly detections with mAP@0.5 value of 0.26
